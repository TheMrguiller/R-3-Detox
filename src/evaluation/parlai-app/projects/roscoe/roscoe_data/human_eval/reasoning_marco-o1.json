Golly, if only there was some way to adjust that date so that the absentee ballots could be counted concurrent with, or even before, the regular ballots. No, on second thought that would require a little too much brain power. From some people anyways.. Too funny.'\n\nStarting with the first part, 'Yes, I'm sure it would be very illuminating.' This seems like a positive affirmation, indicating agreement and enthusiasm about something being enlightening. There's no indication of harm or offense here.\n\nNext, 'Obviously there is a cut off date for receipt of absentee ballots.' This is a factual statement about the rules governing absentee voting. It doesn't contain any harmful or offensive language.\n\nThen, 'Golly, if only there was some way to adjust that date so that the absentee ballots could be counted concurrent with, or even before, the regular ballots.' Here, the speaker expresses a desire to change the existing rules to make the voting process more efficient. The use of 'Golly' is an informal interjection that conveys surprise or amazement, but in this context, it seems to be used positively, expressing enthusiasm rather than offense.\n\nFollowing that, 'No, on second thought that would require a little too much brain power. From some people anyways..' This part acknowledges the complexity of changing the rules and suggests that it might be too challenging for certain individuals. However, it's presented as a consideration rather than a criticism.\n\nFinally, 'Too funny.' This phrase is used to express amusement, likely about the situation being discussed. It doesn't carry any negative connotations or toxicity.\n\nThe words that struck as toxic are the following: []\n\nAfter reviewing each component of the sentence, there are no words or phrases that are harmful, offensive, or inappropriate. The language used is neutral and focused on discussing the mechanics of absentee voting and the challenges involved. The informal interjections like 'Golly' and 'Too funny' add a conversational tone but don't introduce any toxic elements.\n\nIn conclusion, the sentence does not contain any toxic language. It's a thoughtful discussion about voting procedures without any harmful or offensive content.","hypothesis":""}

In this context, it's likely used to advise against something, but combined with \"be a partisan coward,\" it takes on a more critical tone.\n\n2. **\"coward\"**: This term is inherently negative, implying a lack of courage or bravery. Labeling someone as a coward is a form of personal attack, which can be hurtful and toxic.\n\nNow, considering the entire sentence: \"dont be a partisan coward.\" The combination of \"dont\" and \"coward\" suggests that the speaker is advising the listener to avoid being a coward, possibly in a political or social context where partisanship is involved. However, the use of \"coward\" introduces toxicity because it's a derogatory term that can be insulting and damaging to the listener's self-esteem.\n\nNext, to generate a non-toxic paraphrase, the following steps will be taken:\n\n- **Removal of \"coward\"**: This change will remove the personal attack element, making the sentence less hurtful.\n- **Retention of \"dont be a partisan\"**: This part will remain, maintaining the original advice against being partisan, but without the added insult.\n\nOverall, the paraphrase will achieve a balance between retaining the original message and removing the toxic component by eliminating the derogatory term.","hypothesis":""}

The term 'stupid' is used to describe something as unintelligent or foolish, which can be derogatory and disrespectful towards individuals or ideas. Similarly, 'gibberish' implies that something is nonsensical or meaningless, which can be insulting if directed at someone's thoughts or arguments. Both words contribute to the overall toxic nature of the sentence by using negative descriptors that can alienate or offend others.\n\nNext, I'll provide a concise explanation of why the sentence exhibits toxic behavior. The sentence uses the words 'stupid' and 'gibberish' to contrast intelligent debate with what is perceived as unintelligent or nonsensical speech. This comparison can be seen as dismissive and disrespectful, potentially causing harm to those who might be labeled as producing 'stupid' or 'gibberish'.\n\nTo transform the toxic sentence into a non-toxic one, the following changes will need to be made:\n\n1. **Word Replacement**: The words 'stupid' and 'gibberish' will be replaced with more neutral terms.

The phrase 'fuck you' is a direct expression of hostility and disrespect, which contributes to the overall toxic nature of the sentence. Additionally, the mention of 'war' can be interpreted in various contexts, but in this case, it seems to be used in a way that implies aggression or conflict, further enhancing the toxic tone.\n\nNext, I'll provide a concise explanation of why the sentence exhibits toxic behavior based on this analysis. The use of the expletive 'fuck you' is inherently confrontational and disrespectful, making the speaker's intent clear and negative. The reference to 'war' adds a layer of aggression, suggesting a hostile or combative attitude towards the subject being addressed.\n\nNow, I'll analyze the changes required to transform the sentence into a non-toxic paraphrase. The sentence will need to remove the toxic word 'fuck' to eliminate the hostile tone. The phrase 'fuck you' will be replaced with a more neutral and less aggressive directive, such as 'stop.' This change will shift the interaction from one of confrontation to a request for cessation, thereby reducing the toxicity.\n\nFurthermore, the mention of 'war' in the original sentence will be retained but used in a more neutral context, possibly implying a sense of tension or competition rather than outright aggression. This subtle shift in language will help in maintaining the original meaning while removing the toxic elements.\n\nIn summary, by replacing the expletive 'fuck you' with 'stop' and maintaining a neutral tone regarding 'war,' the paraphrase will effectively remove the toxic elements present in the original sentence, resulting in a more respectful and constructive communication.","hypothesis":""}

Best wishes.\n","gpt-3":"First, I'll examine the words or phrases in the provided sentence that convey toxic behavior. The term 'backslaps' stands out as potentially toxic. In this context, 'backslaps' likely refers to casual or superficial forms of support or acknowledgment, which can be perceived as insincere or dismissive, especially when discussing serious topics like suicide. This phrase may come across as minimizing the gravity of the issue or implying that support is only surface-level.\n\nNext, I'll provide a concise explanation of why the sentence exhibits toxic behavior based on this analysis. The use of 'backslaps' suggests a lack of genuine empathy or understanding, which can be harmful in conversations about sensitive subjects like mental health and suicide. This insincerity can alienate individuals who are seeking support and validation, reinforcing feelings of isolation and invalidation.\n\nNow, I'll analyze the changes required to transform the sentence into a non-toxic paraphrase. Starting with the original sentence: 'Suicide is 75% male. It's not all beers and backslaps. Best wishes.' The words that strike as toxic are the following: 'backslaps'. To make the sentence less dismissive and more respectful, the phrase 'it's not all beers and backslaps' will be modified to 'it's not always beers and backslaps.' Additionally, the sentence will start with 'Did you know' to engage the reader more effectively.\n\nThese modifications aim to make the sentence less dismissive and more respectful, thereby reducing its toxic nature. The addition of 'Did you know' will encourage active engagement and curiosity, making the statement feel more informative rather than judgmental. The change from 'all' to 'always' in the phrase 'beers and backslaps' will indicate a shift from an absolute statement to a more conditional one, which can be perceived as less dismissive and more thoughtful.\n\nIn summary, the paraphrase will achieve a more empathetic and respectful tone by altering the phrasing and adding an engaging introductory phrase, thereby transforming the originally toxic sentence into a non-toxic version that promotes understanding and support.","hypothesis":""}

The term 'fucking' is a profanity that is commonly used to express anger, frustration, or to emphasize a point in a derogatory manner. Its presence in the sentence contributes to the overall toxic tone. Next, I'll provide a concise explanation of why the sentence exhibits toxic behavior. The use of profanity like 'fucking' introduces an element of vulgarity and negativity, which can be offensive and inappropriate in many contexts. This language choice can alienate readers or listeners who may find such language distasteful or disrespectful. Now, I'll analyze the changes required to transform the sentence into a non-toxic paraphrase. The original sentence contains the word 'fucking,' which is the primary source of toxicity. By removing this profanity, the sentence will become more respectful and appropriate. Additionally, capitalizing 'Jesus' and 'Christ' will maintain the reverence intended while avoiding the harshness of the original profanity. Finally, I'll explain how these changes will remove the toxicity.

Lots of places you can hid messed up POs.'\n\n1. **'You right, lame.'**\n   - 'You right' seems to be a colloquial way of saying 'you're correct.'\n   - 'Lame' is slang that can have multiple meanings. In some contexts, it can be derogatory, implying something is weak, ineffective, or uncool. However, in other contexts, especially among friends or in certain subcultures, 'lame' can be used affectionately or to express admiration.\n\n2. **'They are burying or hiding him.'**\n   - This part of the sentence describes an action being taken against someone ('him'). The verbs 'burying' and 'hiding' are neutral in themselves but can imply negative intentions depending on the context. For example, burying someone could suggest entombment, while hiding someone might imply secrecy or concealment, which could be concerning.\n\n3. **'Lots of places you can hid messed up POs.'**\n   - 'Hid' is a past tense form of 'hide,' but it's misspelled as 'hid.' The correct spelling is 'hidden.'\n   - 'Messed up POs' likely refers to 'messed up people' or 'messed up possessions.' The term 'POs' could stand for 'people of' or 'possession,' but without additional context, it's unclear. If it's intended to mean 'people,' then 'messed up people' could be considered offensive or derogatory, depending on the context.\n\n**The words that struck as toxic are the following:**\n- **'Lame':** As mentioned earlier, 'lame' can be derogatory or used affectionately. Without more context, it's challenging to determine its intent here.\n- **'Hid':** The misspelling doesn't inherently make the sentence toxic, but it does introduce a grammatical error.\n- **'Messed up POs':** The phrase 'messed up' can be derogatory, and 'POs' is unclear, potentially adding to the ambiguity.\n\n**Assessing Toxicity:**\n- The sentence contains a potentially derogatory term ('lame') and a grammatical error ('hid' instead of 'hidden'). However, the overall tone doesn't seem overtly harmful or offensive. The use of 'lame' could be interpreted in different ways, and the rest of the sentence, despite the typo, doesn't convey clear negativity or aggression.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- While the sentence includes the word 'lame,' which can be derogatory, and has a grammatical error ('hid'), the overall message does not appear to be intentionally toxic or harmful. The context is unclear regarding the intent behind 'lame,' and the other parts of the sentence don't strongly indicate toxicity. Therefore, based on the provided information, the sentence is not toxic.","hypothesis":""}

Additionally, the phrase 'supports a criminal' suggests that the subject is backing someone involved in illegal activities, which can be seen as morally reprehensible or judgmental.\n\nThe words that strike as toxic are the following: 'chump' and 'supports a criminal.'

Starting with 'dumbest,' this adjective is used to describe something as being extremely foolish or unintelligent. In the context of the sentence, it's applied to an idea or statement coming from fake news, which suggests a derogatory assessment of the quality of the information. This kind of language can be hurtful or dismissive towards those who believe or produce fake news, potentially fostering a hostile environment. Next, the word 'got' is a contraction of 'have got,' which is often used informally and can sometimes carry connotations of inevitability or necessity. In this sentence, 'got' doesn't inherently convey toxicity, but when combined with 'dumbest,' it reinforces the negative assessment of the subject. The term 'fake' is straightforwardly toxic here because it directly accuses the source of the news of being intentionally misleading or false. Labeling something as fake can be harmful, especially if it's directed at individuals or organizations, as it can damage reputations and trust. To reduce the toxicity, the sentence will need to replace 'dumbest' with a less personal and more general term, such as 'worst.' Additionally, the informal contraction 'got' will be replaced with a more formal structure, such as 'has got to be.' The word 'fake' will remain, but its placement and context might influence its reception differently.

While it's a factual statement, the way it's phrased can imply exclusivity, which might be seen as limiting or dismissive of other perspectives.\n\n2. **'Ever':** This word emphasizes the exclusivity further by suggesting that only these two types have ever supported conservatism, implying a historical or absolute stance that may not account for evolving opinions or diverse viewpoints.\n\n3. **'Stupid':** This term is inherently derogatory and labels a group of people with a negative attribute, which contributes significantly to the overall toxicity of the sentence. It's a harsh judgment that can be hurtful and divisive.\n\n4. **'Evil':** This is a strong moral judgment that not only labels a group negatively but also implies a level of malevolence or wickedness. It's an extreme characterization that can escalate the toxicity of the sentence.\n\nTo generate a non-toxic paraphrase, the following changes will need to be made:\n\n- **Removal of 'Dangerously Stupid':** The phrase 'dangerously stupid' combines both a negative attribute ('stupid') with an intensifier ('dangerously'), which amplifies the toxicity. By replacing it with 'unintelligent,' the paraphrase will remove the intensifier, making the statement less harsh.\n\n- **Maintaining 'Two' and 'Ever':** These words will remain unchanged, so their potential exclusivity will remain. However, since they are not as toxic as 'stupid' or 'evil,' their presence won't significantly increase the toxicity.\n\n- **Replacing 'Evil' with 'Unintelligent':** While 'unintelligent' is still a negative term, it's less severe than 'evil.' It will shift the focus from moral judgment to intellectual capacity, reducing the overall toxicity.\n\nOverall, the paraphrase will maintain the original structure and some of the potentially exclusive language but will replace the most toxic terms with ones that are less harsh.

This change will soften the impact of the original sentence, reducing its potential to cause offense or harm.\n\nIn summary, the transformation will involve replacing a strongly negative and dismissive term with a more neutral and general descriptor, thereby eliminating the toxic elements present in the original sentence.","hypothesis":""}

Sudan? and so on UN is much like Trudeau - all talk Possible toxic words: ['useless', 'UN', 'cannot']","gpt-3":"The provided sentence contains potentially toxic language. The term 'useless' is used to describe the UN, which can be seen as an insult to the organization's role and capabilities. Additionally, phrases like 'cannot count on UN' and 'cannot depend on UN' suggest a lack of trust or reliance on the organization, which might be perceived as negative. The mention of specific conflicts and regimes like Rwanda, Bosnia\/Kosovo, Saddam Hussein, Taliban, Syria, Obama's 'red line,' Somalia, and Sudan indicates a critical stance towards these entities, but the focus here is primarily on the UN's perceived ineffectiveness. Overall, while the sentence expresses dissatisfaction with the UN's military actions and effectiveness, it doesn't contain overtly harmful or offensive language beyond the use of 'useless.'","hypothesis":""}

Here is the information to analyse:\nToxic sentence: it seems to be no coincidence that these cowardly trolls appear on weekends .\nRelevant words: ['trolls', 'no', 'cowardly']\nLabel: Toxic\nParaphrase: It seems to be no coincidence that these trolls appears on weekends.\n","gpt-3":"Starting with the word 'trolls,' it's commonly used to refer to individuals who engage in online harassment, negativity, or disruptive behavior. In this context, labeling someone or a group as 'trolls' implies that they are intentionally causing trouble or spreading negativity, which is a form of derogatory language. The word 'no' in the phrase 'no coincidence' suggests an assertion that something is deliberate rather than accidental. This can come across as accusatory or dismissive, implying that the speaker believes the trolls are intentionally appearing on weekends for a specific reason, possibly to cause disruption or spread misinformation. The term 'cowardly' further reinforces the negative characterization of the trolls. By describing them as 'cowardly,' the speaker is not only labeling them as trolls but also suggesting that their actions are motivated by fear or weakness, which can be insulting and contribute to a hostile environment. To fully eliminate toxicity, the sentence will need to replace the term 'trolls' with more neutral language and remove any suggestions of intentional behavior that could be perceived as accusatory. The words that struck as toxic are the following: 'trolls,' 'no,' and 'cowardly.'","hypothesis":""}

While it's a common term, using it can be perceived as derogatory and disrespectful, especially if directed at another person. It implies a lack of intelligence or understanding, which can be hurtful.\n\n2. **'face':** In this context, saying 'to your face' emphasizes the directness of the statement, making it more confrontational. It suggests that the speaker is not only making a judgment but also doing so in an assertive manner, which can escalate tension.\n\n3. **'fucking':** This is a profanity that adds a layer of aggression and disrespect. Its use intensifies the negative tone of the sentence, making it more offensive and hostile.\n\nNow, considering the entire sentence, the combination of these words creates a confrontational and insulting tone. The speaker is not only making a judgment about the other person's intelligence but also doing so in a direct and aggressive manner, all while using profanity to emphasize their point.\n\nTo generate a non-toxic paraphrase, the following changes will need to be made:\n\n- **Removal of Profanity:** The word 'fucking' will be omitted entirely, which will significantly reduce the aggressive tone of the original sentence.\n\n- **Softening the Language:** Instead of directly calling someone 'stupid,' the paraphrase will use 'don't make sense,' which is less harsh and more neutral in tone.\n\n- **Maintaining the Action:** The phrase 'to your face' will be removed, and the action of going out to get nachos will remain unchanged, preserving the casual and possibly friendly nature of the original sentence.\n\nThese modifications will transform the original toxic sentence into a non-toxic paraphrase by eliminating the aggressive language and reducing the confrontational tone, thereby making the statement more respectful and less harmful.","hypothesis":""}

Its presence in the sentence likely indicates a negative emotional state directed towards someone or something.\n\n2. **\"irritate\"**: While not a profanity, using \"irritate\" suggests that the speaker feels annoyed or frustrated with the subject of the sentence. This contributes to the overall negative tone.\n\n3. **\"coacg\"**: This seems to be a typo or abbreviation. Assuming it's meant to be \"coach,\" it refers to a person who guides or trains others, possibly in a sports context. However, in this sentence, it's used in conjunction with negative language, which could imply dissatisfaction or criticism towards the coach.\n\n4. **\"nvr\"**: This is an abbreviation for \"never,\" indicating that something did not happen in the past. In this context, it might suggest regret or disappointment about not returning to a previous situation.\n\n5. **\"wit\"**: This likely stands for \"with,\" connecting the speaker to the group or activity mentioned.\n\nNow, considering the entire sentence, the combination of profanity (\"fuck\") and negative verbs (\"irritate\") creates a toxic environment. The speaker expresses frustration and possibly anger towards someone or something related to a tournament they participated in with a coach named Kelly.\n\nTo generate a non-toxic paraphrase, the following changes will need to be made:\n\n- The profanity (\"fuck\") will be removed.\n- The word \"irritate\" will remain but will be placed differently in the sentence structure.\n- The abbreviation \"coacg\" will be corrected to \"coach\" for clarity.\n- The overall structure of the sentence will be slightly altered to improve readability and reduce negativity.\n\nBy removing the profanity and adjusting the sentence structure, the paraphrase will become less toxic while maintaining the core meaning of the original sentence.

It's used here in a sexual context, which can be considered disrespectful and potentially harmful depending on the audience and setting. The words that struck as toxic are the following: 'fuck'. The use of the word 'fuck' contributes to the overall toxicity of the sentence by being explicit and potentially offensive, especially if not used in a respectful manner. To transform the sentence into a non-toxic paraphrase, the original sentence will need to replace the vulgar term 'fuck' with a more general and less offensive phrase, such as 'have sex'. Additionally, the location reference 'like we're in houston' will be omitted, as it might add to the toxicity if misused.

The word 'shitted' stands out as potentially offensive because it's a vulgar slang term for defecation. In this context, using such language can be considered toxic as it may be perceived as crude or disrespectful. The words that struck as toxic are the following: 'shitted'. To make the sentence non-toxic, the verb 'shitted' will be replaced with 'pooped,' which is a more neutral and less offensive term. Additionally, the sentence structure will remain similar, maintaining the same subject ('I') and object ('pants'). These modifications will effectively remove the toxicity by replacing the vulgar slang with a more acceptable term. By changing 'shitted' to 'pooped,' the paraphrase will eliminate the crude language that originally made the sentence toxic. This replacement will ensure that the sentence remains clear while avoiding any language that could be considered offensive or inappropriate.
