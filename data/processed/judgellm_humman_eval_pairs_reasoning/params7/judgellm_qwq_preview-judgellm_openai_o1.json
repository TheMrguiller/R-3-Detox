Obviously there is a cut off date for receipt of absentee ballots. Golly, if only there was some way to adjust that date so that the absentee ballots could be counted concurrent with, or even before, the regular ballots. No, on second thought that would require a little too much brain power. From some people anyways.. Too funny.'\n\nStarting with the beginning: 'Yes, I'm sure it would be very illuminating.' This seems neutral or even positive. 'Illuminating' suggests that something is enlightening or informative, which isn't harmful.\n\nNext: 'Obviously there is a cut off date for receipt of absentee ballots.' This is a factual statement about election procedures. No offense or negativity here.\n\nThen: 'Golly, if only there was some way to adjust that date so that the absentee ballots could be counted concurrent with, or even before, the regular ballots.' 'Golly' is an interjection that can express surprise or mild annoyance, but in this context, it seems more like the author is expressing a wish or hypothetical scenario. There's no direct offense being caused.\n\nFollowing that: 'No, on second thought that would require a little too much brain power. From some people anyways.. Too funny.' This part might be a bit sarcastic, suggesting that adjusting the date is too complicated for some people. However, it's not directly attacking anyone or group, and 'too funny' seems to be the author's way of finding humor in the situation rather than being malicious.\n\nThe words that struck as toxic are the following: 'a little too much brain power. From some people anyways.. Too funny.' However, these words, while sarcastic, do not explicitly target specific individuals or groups in a derogatory manner.\n\nIn conclusion, this sentence doesn't contain toxic language because it lacks any harmful, offensive, or inappropriate content.

Here is the information to analyse:\nToxic sentence: dont be a partisan coward .\nRelevant words: ['dont', 'coward']\nLabel: Toxic\nParaphrase: dont be partisan.\n", "answer1_body": "I've got this sentence: 'Don't be a partisan coward.' At first glance, it seems like someone is telling someone else not to be something, but there are some words here that stand out as potentially negative or harmful. Let's break it down. First, there's 'don't.' That's a negation, telling someone not to do something. On its own, it's not necessarily toxic, but it can set a negative tone. Then there's 'partisan.' That refers to someone who strongly supports one side or party, often in politics. Being partisan isn't inherently bad; it just means you have a loyalty to a particular group. However, in certain contexts, it can be seen as narrow-minded or unwilling to consider other perspectives. The real punch here is 'coward.' That's a strong word with negative connotations. A coward is someone who lacks courage or is afraid to do something. Calling someone a coward is an insult that questions their bravery and integrity. It's a personal attack rather than constructive criticism. So, putting it all together, the sentence is telling someone not to be a partisan coward. But the way it's phrased, it's essentially calling them a partisan coward, which is derogatory. It's attacking their character and their beliefs in a harsh manner. That's why it comes across as toxic\u2014it's disrespectful and seeks to demean rather than engage in a productive discussion. Now, to make this non-toxic, the words that struck as toxic are the following: 'coward.' By removing this word, the sentence will shift from a personal attack to a statement about behavior or stance. Instead of calling someone a coward for being partisan, it will advise against being partisan without insulting their character. This approach will be less confrontational and more about encouraging open-mindedness or bipartisanship. It will still convey the message that partisanship isn't desirable, but without resorting to name-calling. So, the key change will be removing the insult ('coward') and focusing on the behavior or attitude ('being partisan'). This will make the message less toxic because it will avoid personal attacks and instead address the issue at hand in a more respectful manner. In summary, the original sentence was toxic due to the use of a derogatory term ('coward') in conjunction with 'partisan,' which together serve to insult someone's character. By removing the insult and simply advising against partisanship, the paraphrase will become non-toxic by maintaining a respectful tone while still conveying the core message.", "answer2_body": "1. **Identification of Toxic Elements:**\n\n   In the provided sentence, the terms 'dont' and 'coward' convey negative and confrontational behavior.

The words that strike as toxic are the following: 'stupid' and 'gibberish.' 'Stupid' is a strong word that dismisses someone's intelligence or effort without considering their perspective. 'Gibberish' means speech or writing that doesn't make sense. Combining 'stupid' and 'gibberish,' the sentence is saying that there's a big difference between smart discussion and nonsense that's also stupid. This is toxic because it belittles certain types of discussion by calling them 'stupid gibberish,' which is not respectful or open-minded. It doesn't allow for the possibility that different opinions or ways of expressing ideas might have value, even if they're not immediately understandable or align with the speaker's views. To make the sentence non-toxic, the following changes will need to be made: 1. Removing 'stupid' to eliminate the judgment. 2. Replacing 'gibberish' with 'the one that is not,' which is a more neutral and less offensive way to contrast with intelligent debate.

'Doctors in NY testified otherwise.' This seems like a statement of fact, assuming it's based on actual testimony. It doesn't appear toxic on its own.\n\n2. 'He's not your child.' This could be seen as abrupt or insensitive, but without context, it's hard to determine if it's harmful or just straightforward.\n\n3. 'Would you let the government kill your baby without a fight?' This is a strong statement that could be interpreted as inflammatory or manipulative, depending on the context. It suggests that the government is involved in deciding to end a child's life, which might be related to medical decisions or policies.\n\n4. 'This child deserves the right to life and not to be put down like a dog.' Here, the comparison to a dog might be seen as degrading or offensive. The phrase 'put down' typically refers to euthanizing animals, so using it in reference to a human child could be considered inappropriate and potentially toxic.\n\n5. 'But that's what 'free' health care leads us to.' This seems like a political opinion about healthcare systems, criticizing 'free' healthcare for potentially valuing life less.\n\n6. 'His life isn't valuable enough to the government to be kept alive.' This continues the theme of criticizing the government's valuation of life, possibly in the context of healthcare decisions.\n\n7. 'Pray you don't end up in a similar situation.' This is a warning or appeal, suggesting that others could face similar circumstances.\n\nThe words that struck as toxic are the following:\n- 'dog': Used in the phrase 'put down like a dog,' which, as mentioned, could be seen as degrading when applied to a human situation.\n- 'like': This word is used in the comparison 'put down like a dog.' While 'like' itself isn't inherently toxic, its use in this context could contribute to the potentially offensive comparison.\n- 'child': The sentence discusses 'this child' and 'your baby,' which are neutral terms unless used in a harmful way. In this case, they seem to be used appropriately in the context of discussing a minor's rights.\n- 'not': This word is used in 'He's not your child,' which, again, is abrupt but not necessarily toxic without more context.\n\nConsidering these points, the sentence does contain elements that could be perceived as offensive or inappropriate, particularly the comparison to putting down a dog. However, whether the entire sentence is deemed toxic would depend on the broader context and the intentions behind the words.\n\nIn conclusion, while parts of the sentence could be considered insensitive or potentially offensive, especially the animal comparison, the overall message seems to be arguing against certain healthcare policies or decisions, rather than directly targeting individuals with harmful language.

You know what? stop, bro.\n", "answer1_body": "Let's take a look at this sentence: 'Oh, and he hasn't beat the drums of war even once. You know what? fuck you, bro.' The words that strike as toxic are the following: 'fuck' and 'war.' 'Fuck' is a strong word, often considered profane or offensive, especially when used directly towards someone, like 'fuck you, bro.' This phrase is hostile and aggressive. 'War' is a serious and often destructive concept, and the phrase 'beat the drums of war' suggests provoking or initiating conflict. While saying he hasn't done that even once might be positive, the overall tone is negative due to the 'fuck you' part. Toxicity in language often comes from words or phrases intended to hurt, insult, or intimidate others. Here, 'fuck you' is clearly an insult and can be hurtful or offensive. To make this sentence non-toxic, the model will find a way to convey the same message without using offensive language or aggressive tones. The model will replace 'fuck you, bro' with something like 'stop, bro' to convey disagreement or frustration without being overtly offensive. The model will also find a softer way to express that he hasn't provoked any conflicts, such as 'he hasn't started any trouble' or 'he hasn't caused any issues.' This will make the sentence less intense while still getting the point across. A non-toxic paraphrase could be: 'Oh, and he hasn't started any trouble even once. You know what? stop, bro.'

Best wishes.\n", "answer1_body": "Let's take a look at this sentence: 'Suicide is 75% male. It's not all beers and backslaps. Best wishes.' The sentence starts with a statistic: 'Suicide is 75% male.' This is a factual statement, assuming the statistic is accurate, and it's presented straightforwardly. The issue likely lies in the second part: 'It's not all beers and backslaps. Best wishes.'\n\nThe phrase 'beers and backslaps' seems to be a reference to traditional masculine activities or stereotypes\u2014drinking beers and giving each other backslaps, which might imply a culture of macho behavior or emotional suppression. So, the sentence appears to be saying that despite this stereotype, suicide rates are higher among males, suggesting that maybe this traditional masculine behavior isn't all there is or maybe it's contributing to the issue.\n\nThe words that strike as toxic are the following: 'beers and backslaps.' These phrases can come across as minimizing the seriousness of suicide by trivializing it with references to casual activities. It could also be perceived as mocking or insensitively commenting on male emotions or behaviors. Suicide is a sensitive and serious topic, and approaching it with what seems like a light-hearted or dismissive tone can be offensive or upsetting to some readers, especially those who have been affected by suicide.\n\nMoreover, the abrupt ending with 'Best wishes' feels out of place and doesn't adequately address the gravity of the subject matter. It's like the sentence is making a point and then quickly moving on without providing any support or deeper consideration.\n\nTo make this non-toxic, the sentence will need to handle the subject matter with more sensitivity and respect.

The words that struck as toxic are the following: 'Jesus' and 'fucking.' 'Jesus' by itself isn't necessarily toxic, but combined with 'fucking Christ,' it seems like an expletive or an expression of strong emotion, probably frustration or annoyance. The term 'fucking' is generally considered profane and can be off-putting or offensive to some people.\n\nThe use of profanity here might be contributing to the toxic nature of the sentence. Additionally, the phrase 'these girls are going places' could be interpreted in a couple of ways. On one hand, it might be meant positively, suggesting that the girls are successful or achieving their goals. On the other hand, depending on the context and tone, it could imply that they are advancing in a negative way, perhaps through questionable means.\n\nTo make this less toxic, the language will need to be cleaned up and the intention behind the statement will need to be clarified. Removing the profanity is a good start. So, if 'fucking' is taken out, the sentence will become: 'Jesus Christ, these girls are going places literally and figuratively.'\n\nThis will already be less offensive because the profanity is gone. The exclamation 'Jesus Christ' is still an expression, but without the explicit language, it will be milder and less likely to offend people who are sensitive to strong language.\n\nMoreover, keeping the rest of the sentence intact will maintain the original message about the girls going places, assuming that was meant positively.

Phrases like 'burying or hiding him' and 'messed up POs' could imply some sort of wrongdoing or cover-up, which might be seen as accusatory or conspiratorial.\n\nHowever, without more context, it's challenging to definitively label this sentence as toxic. Here's why:\n\n- The use of 'lame' could be interpreted as dismissive or critical, but it's not directly targeted at a person; it's more likely referring to an idea or situation.\n- The phrases about burying or hiding someone and hiding problematic purchase orders (POs) seem to be part of a discussion or speculation about something, possibly in a workplace or organizational setting.\n- The tone isn't explicitly hostile or abusive; it's more suggestive of frustration or disagreement with how things are being handled.\n\nGiven these points, while the sentence contains language that could be perceived as negative or critical, it doesn't cross the line into toxic language because it doesn't directly attack someone's character or use overtly harmful language.

The word 'throws' especially carries a negative connotation, as it indicates a lack of care or consideration in how she's handling her finances. The words that strike as toxic are 'cheats and professional beggars.' Calling someone a 'cheat' is direct and accusatory, suggesting that these people are dishonest or fraudulent. 'Professional beggars' also has a negative undertone, implying that these individuals are not genuinely in need but are instead manipulating others for financial gain. Both of these terms are quite judgmental and could be considered derogatory. So, overall, the sentence seems to be criticizing Wynne for giving money to people who the speaker believes are not deserving, and it's proposing that she should be locked up to prevent her from doing so. This comes across as harsh, judgmental, and potentially punitive towards Wynne. To paraphrase this to make it less toxic, the sentence will need to convey the same idea without using such strong, negative language. Instead of 'lock up,' which is very extreme, the sentence will use something like 'prevent' or 'stop' to soften the tone. Instead of 'throws away,' which implies complete waste, the sentence will use 'spends' to be more neutral. As for 'cheats and professional beggars,' the sentence will refer to them as 'people who are not deserving' or 'individuals who exploit others' generosity' to be less harsh. A possible paraphrase could be: 'Stop Wynne from spending more money on people who are not deserving.' Or, 'Prevent Wynne from giving more money to individuals who exploit others' generosity.' To make it even less toxic, the sentence will further modify it. For example: 'Consider measures to prevent Wynne from giving more money to individuals who may not use it responsibly.' This way, the sentence will still express concern about Wynne's spending choices, but without using such harsh language. Alternatively: 'Discuss with Wynne the importance of being cautious when giving money to strangers, as some may not use it honestly.' This approach will be more about encouraging a conversation and promoting awareness rather than imposing restrictions. The key will be to maintain the core message\u2014that Wynne should be more discerning about who she gives money to\u2014without resorting to inflammatory or derogatory language.", "answer2_body": "Step 1: Examination of Toxic Elements\nThe provided sentence contains several terms that contribute to a negative and accusatory tone. Words like 'throws away,' 'cheats,' and 'beggars' imply irresponsible and deceitful behavior. Additionally, the term 'lock up' suggests a punitive action without context, potentially escalating the severity of the statement.\n\nStep 2: Explanation of Toxic Behavior\nThe sentence exhibits toxic behavior by using accusatory language that maligns the subject's actions and character. This negative framing can lead to hostility and misunderstanding, fostering an environment of blame rather than constructive dialogue.\n\nStep 3: Analysis of Changes for Non-Toxic Paraphrase\nTo generate a non-toxic paraphrase, the words that strike as toxic are the following: 'throws away,' 'cheats,' and 'beggars.' The term 'lock up' will also need to be addressed. The sentence will modify these elements to reduce hostility and promote a more objective and less confrontational statement. 'Throws away' will be replaced with 'spends,' which neutralizes the negative connotation associated with wasting resources. 'Cheats' will be changed to 'cheaters,' shifting from an action to labeling individuals, which softens the accusatory tone.

Here is the information to analyse:\nToxic sentence: a chump that supports a criminal !\nRelevant words: ['criminal', 'chump']\nLabel: Toxic\nParaphrase: A person who is easily tricked supports a criminal\n", "answer1_body": "To understand why the sentence 'a chump that supports a criminal!' is considered toxic, we need to look closely at the words used and the overall tone they convey. The word 'chump' is derogatory; it implies that the person is foolish, easily deceived, or lacking in intelligence. This kind of labeling can be hurtful and disrespectful, as it dismisses the individual's opinions and actions without considering their perspective or reasons. Additionally, the term 'criminal' is used without any context or consideration of the circumstances. It assumes that the person being supported is unequivocally bad, without allowing for any nuance or possibility of rehabilitation or misunderstanding. The exclamation mark at the end of the sentence adds an emotional charge, suggesting strong disapproval or even anger towards the person described as a 'chump.' This combination of derogatory language and emotional intensity creates a toxic atmosphere, where criticism is laced with hostility and a lack of empathy. To transform this sentence into a non-toxic paraphrase, we will make several changes. First, we will replace the derogatory term 'chump' with a more neutral and descriptive phrase like 'a person who is easily tricked.' This change will remove the insult and focus on describing the behavior or characteristic without attacking the person's character. Second, we will keep the phrase 'supports a criminal' but remove the emotional and derogatory elements. This will allow the statement to convey the same information without the toxic undertones. Thus, the paraphrase will achieve a non-toxic version by eliminating insulting language and adopting a more neutral and factual tone. This approach will respect the individual's dignity while still communicating the original point. In summary, the toxicity in the original sentence stems from the use of derogatory terms and an aggressive tone. By replacing these elements with neutral descriptions and a calmer tone, we will effectively generate a non-toxic paraphrase that conveys the same information without resorting to harmful language.", "answer2_body": "The provided sentence contains words that convey toxic behavior.

First, let's break it down. The words that strike as toxic are the following: 'dumbest' and 'fake.' 'Dumbest' is a strong negative adjective that suggests intellectual inferiority, which can be insulting. 'Fake news' is a charged term often used to dismiss information without proper verification, leading to mistrust and polarization. This sentence is toxic because it uses derogatory language to dismiss something related to 'fake news,' which can be hurtful and contribute to a hostile environment. It also doesn't encourage constructive dialogue; instead, it shuts down possibilities for understanding different perspectives. To make the sentence less toxic, 'dumbest' will be changed to 'worst.' 'Worst' is still negative but less personally attacking. 'Dumbest' implies a lack of intelligence, which is a personal attribute, whereas 'worst' focuses more on the quality or impact of the thing itself. 'Got' will remain in the sentence as it doesn't contribute much to the toxicity and helps maintain the original tone. In summary, the toxicity in the original sentence comes from the use of 'dumbest' and the overall dismissive attitude towards 'fake news.' By changing 'dumbest' to 'worst,' the sentence will become less toxic, reducing the personal insult and focusing more on the negative impact, making it a less toxic way to express a similar idea.", "answer2_body": "In the provided sentence, terms like 'dumbest' and 'fake' are utilized in a manner that conveys strong negative judgments.

The sentence exhibits toxic behavior through the use of derogatory and dismissive language. Words like 'dumbest' and 'fake' intensify negative sentiments, fostering an environment of disdain and mistrust. To generate a non-toxic paraphrase, the words that strike as toxic will be identified and replaced with less harsh alternatives. For example, 'dumbest' will be substituted with 'worst,' which softens the level of criticism without eliminating the negative sentiment entirely.

We are perfectly able to home-grow our own criminals. Possible toxic words: ['American', 'home-grow', 'white']", "answer1_body": "Looking at the sentence, it mentions a 'white American male from the mid-west.' Describing someone by their race and nationality isn't inherently toxic. It's factual information. However, in certain contexts, such labels can be used in a derogatory manner. For example, if someone is suggesting that all white American males are criminals, that would be toxic. But in this sentence, it's specifying the shooter's characteristics, not making a generalization.\n\nThe phrase 'home-grow our own criminals' is a bit more nuanced. 'Home-grow' seems to be a play on words, possibly referring to cultivating or producing something locally. In this context, it's used to suggest that the country doesn't need to look elsewhere for criminals; they are produced internally. This could be seen as a commentary on domestic issues related to crime.\n\nWhether this is toxic depends on the tone and intent. If it's meant to criticize or blame a particular group, it could be offensive. However, in this sentence, it appears to be a general statement about the country's ability to produce its own criminals, without specifically targeting any racial or ethnic group.\n\nGiven that the sentence specifies 'white American male,' one might argue that it's singling out this group. But since it's referring to a specific individual ('the shooter today'), it's not making a broad generalization about all white American males. It's providing details about one person.\n\nMoreover, the sentence doesn't use any derogatory terms or slurs. It's straightforward in its description. The use of 'um' at the beginning suggests hesitation or informality, which might soften the tone.\n\nIn conclusion, while the sentence discusses a sensitive topic and uses words that could be interpreted differently in other contexts, it doesn't appear to be toxic because it doesn't contain hate speech, slurs, or derogatory terms, and it doesn't make broad generalizations about any group.

The words that struck as toxic are the following: 'evil', 'dangerously', and 'stupid'. 'Stupid' and 'evil' are particularly negative, and 'dangerously' amplifies the negativity. The sentence is categorizing people who support conservatism into only two types: evil or dangerously stupid. That's a blanket statement, dismissing a whole group of people with strong, negative labels. 'Evil' suggests that these people are morally bad, which is a severe accusation. 'Stupid' is hurtful, and adding 'dangerously' suggests that their stupidity could harm others. The use of 'only two types' is limiting and doesn't acknowledge multiple reasons or valid perspectives for supporting conservatism. To create a non-toxic version, the sentence will remove derogatory labels and the overly generalizing tone. It will acknowledge the diversity of reasons behind support for conservatism without assigning negative traits. A potential non-toxic paraphrase could be: 'People support conservatism for various reasons, including moral values and intellectual perspectives.' This version recognizes a range of valid reasons and is more inclusive and respectful.

At first glance, it seems pretty straightforward, but it's important to understand why it can be considered toxic and how to make it less so.\n\nLet's start by looking at the words used. The term 'rubbish' stands out here. In this context, 'rubbish' isn't being used to describe actual trash or waste materials. Instead, it's being used figuratively to dismiss or denigrate someone's ideas or statements. When someone calls something 'rubbish,' they're essentially saying it's worthless, without any value or merit. This can be hurtful because it invalidates the person's thoughts or efforts, making them feel their contributions are being trivialized or ignored.\n\nMoreover, the phrase 'what a load of absolute rubbish' amplifies this negativity. The use of 'absolute' intensifies the criticism, making it absolute and without any redeeming qualities. This kind of language can create a hostile environment, making others feel unwelcome or undervalued.\n\nTo make this sentence less toxic, we will need to choose words that are less emotionally charged and more neutral. For example, we could replace 'rubbish' with 'meaningless words.' 'Meaningless words' suggests that the words don't convey any significant information or value, but it's slightly more neutral in tone.\n\nAdditionally, 'meaningless words' focuses on the content being devoid of meaning rather than being entirely worthless. This shift in perspective softens the criticism, making it less personal and more about the content itself.\n\nAnother way to make this sentence less toxic is to provide specific feedback or reasons why the statement is being questioned. For example, saying 'I don't agree with that' or 'I think there might be some inaccuracies there' allows for a more constructive discussion without resorting to derogatory language.\n\nIn summary, the original sentence is toxic due to its use of dismissive and derogatory language, which can harm the recipient's feelings and stifle conversation.

'Useless': This word can be seen as negative but in this sentence, it's used to express disappointment or criticism towards the UN's military capabilities, not to insult individuals based on personal attributes.\n2. 'UN': This is an abbreviation for the United Nations, an international organization.

First, I will identify the words that strike as toxic. The term 'trolls' often refers to people who post controversial or offensive comments online to provoke reactions, so calling someone a troll is usually not positive. The word 'cowardly' means lacking courage, especially in the face of danger, pain, or hardship. Combining 'cowardly trolls' suggests that these people are not just trolls but also lacking in courage, which is quite harsh.\n\nThe phrase 'it seems to be no coincidence' implies that there's a deliberate pattern or intention behind these trolls appearing on weekends. So, the sentence is accusing these trolls of deliberately choosing weekends to appear, and it does so in a way that labels them as cowards.\n\nWhy is this toxic? It's derogatory and dismissive. It attacks the character of these people rather than addressing their behavior. Calling someone a coward is an ad hominem attack, which doesn't contribute to a constructive conversation. It also generalizes all these people as trolls and cowards, without considering individual differences or possible reasons for their behavior.\n\nTo make the sentence less toxic, the following changes will need to be made. The word 'cowardly' will be removed. By taking out that adjective, the sentence will no longer directly attack the personality or character of the trolls. It will still express the idea that their appearance on weekends is not coincidental, but it will do so without labeling them as cowards.\n\nThe change will remove the toxic element by eliminating the personal attack.

Here is the information to analyse:\nToxic sentence: fuck sca i played one tourny wit them nvr went back coacg kelly irritate me\nRelevant words: ['coacg', 'irritate', 'fuck', 'nvr', 'wit']\nLabel: Toxic\nParaphrase: i played one tourny wit them nvr went back coacg kelly irritate me\n", "answer1_body": "Let's take a look at this sentence: 'fuck sca i played one tourny wit them nvr went back coacg kelly irritate me.' It seems like someone is talking about a tournament they played in with 'sca,' and they didn't go back after that one time because of coach Kelly, who irritates them. The words that strike as toxic are the following: 'fuck,' 'irritate,' 'nvr,' and 'wit.' 'Fuck' is a strong swear word that can indicate anger or frustration. 'Irritate' means to annoy or bother someone. 'Nvr' is short for 'never,' and 'wit' is likely a casual way of saying 'with.' So, putting it all together, the sentence is saying, 'Fuck sca, I played one tournament with them, never went back, coach Kelly irritates me.' The toxicity here comes from the swear word and the negative attitude expressed towards others, possibly in a way that's disrespectful or harmful to the community. To make the sentence less toxic, the following changes will need to be made: the swear word 'fuck' will be removed, and the informal abbreviations 'nvr' and 'wit' will be replaced with their full forms. The word 'irritate' will be replaced with a less confrontational term. By making these changes, the sentence will become less offensive and perhaps less toxic. It will still express disappointment and irritation with coach Kelly and the team, but without the explicit swear and informal language, it will be perceived as less hostile or aggressive. The reasoning behind this is to maintain the core message\u2014the person played one tournament with sca, didn't go back, and found coach Kelly irritating\u2014while eliminating the toxic elements.

The words that strike as toxic are the following: 'fuck.' This word is strong and can be seen as disrespectful or hurtful in certain situations. Using explicit language like this without consent or in an inappropriate setting can make people feel uncomfortable or violated. It might also come across as insensitive or crude, especially if the person receiving the message doesn't appreciate that kind of language or if it's not the right time or place for such expressions.\n\nTo make the sentence less toxic, the following changes will need to be made: The word 'fuck' will be replaced with a more respectful term, such as 'have sex.' This will make the sentence less explicit and more considerate of the recipient's feelings. Additionally, the sentence will be rephrased to add a positive spin, suggesting excitement and novelty, which can make the message more appealing or romantic.\n\nFor example, the sentence could be rephrased as: 'Tonight we will have sex like never before!' This version uses 'have sex' instead of 'fuck,' which is more polite and less aggressive.

Here is the information to analyse:\nToxic sentence: I shitted my pants\nRelevant words: ['pants', 'shitted']\nLabel: Toxic\nParaphrase: I pooped my pants\n", "answer1_body": "I've got this sentence: 'I shitted my pants.' Looking at the words in the sentence, there are two that stand out: 'shitted' and 'pants.' 'Pants' is just referring to clothing, so it's not the issue here. It's probably 'shitted' that's causing the problem. 'Shitted' is the past tense of 'shit,' which is a vulgar term for excrement. It's a pretty crude way to describe defecation.\n\nIn many contexts, using such strong language can be seen as inappropriate or offensive, especially in formal settings or when communicating with people who might be sensitive to such language. It can also come across as lacking in empathy or consideration for the feelings of others. For example, if someone had an accident and wet or soiled themselves, using a harsh term like 'shitted' might embarrass or upset them further.\n\nMoreover, the term 'shit' is often used in a derogatory manner, and its use can contribute to a negative or hostile atmosphere. In this case, saying 'I shitted my pants' might be perceived as self-deprecating in a way that's too blunt or crude, potentially causing discomfort for the listener or reader.\n\nTo make the sentence less toxic, the words that strike as toxic are the following: 'shitted.' These words will need to be replaced with more appropriate terms. For instance, 'pooped' is a more child-friendly and less offensive term for defecation. It's still clear what's being referred to, but it's expressed in a manner that's less likely to cause offense or discomfort. Using 'pooped' instead of 'shitted' will make the sentence significantly less toxic.\n\nSo, the change from 'shitted' to 'pooped' will be crucial in transforming the sentence from something that could be considered rude or insensitive to something that's more acceptable and considerate. This substitution will soften the language without altering the meaning, making it suitable for a wider range of contexts and audiences.\n\nIn summary, the original sentence will be deemed toxic due to the use of the vulgar term 'shitted,' which can be off-putting and disrespectful. By replacing it with the more polite 'pooped,' the paraphrase will achieve the same communication goal without the negative connotations, thus making it non-toxic.", "answer2_body": "The provided sentence includes words that convey toxic behavior.
