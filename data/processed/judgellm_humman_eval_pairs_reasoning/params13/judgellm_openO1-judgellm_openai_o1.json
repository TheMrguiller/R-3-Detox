No, on second thought that would require a little too much brain power. From some people anyways.. Too funny.' The words that struck as toxic are the following: 'golly' is an expression of surprise or excitement, which is generally not offensive. The phrase 'cut off date' is a standard term used in various contexts, including elections, and doesn't carry any negative connotation. The word 'absentee' relates to ballots and is neutral. The phrase 'brain power' is a colloquial way of saying intelligence or mental capacity, and it's not offensive. The phrase 'from some people anyways' seems to imply a general statement and doesn't target any specific group, which could be neutral or slightly casual but not toxic. The word 'funny' is positive and indicates humor. I don't see any harmful, offensive, or inappropriate language in the sentence. The tone seems to be casual and inquiring, discussing the possibility of adjusting a deadline for absentee ballots. There's no language that targets or demeans any individual or group, nor is there any profanity, slurs, or derogatory terms present. Additionally, the sentence doesn't contain any sarcasm or hidden meanings that could be interpreted negatively. The use of 'Too funny' at the end suggests that the speaker finds the situation amusing, which is a positive sentiment.

The phrase 'fuck you, bro' is overtly offensive and contains profanity, which is a clear indicator of toxicity. The word 'fuck' is a strong expletive that can cause offense, and using it in a sentence directed at someone makes the statement aggressive and disrespectful. The phrase 'beat the drums of war' is metaphorical, suggesting incitement or escalation of conflict. While 'war' itself can be a neutral term in certain contexts, in this sentence, it's used in a way that implies hostility or aggression, which aligns with the overall toxic sentiment. The words that struck as toxic are the following: 'fuck', 'war'. To make the sentence less offensive, the offensive word 'fuck' will be replaced with a milder and non-offensive term. The phrase 'beat the drums of war' will remain unchanged, but the overall tone will be less confrontational. The change from 'fuck you, bro' to 'stop, bro' will shift the interaction from a personal, offensive command to a more neutral request, thereby removing the toxicity. This alteration will transform the sentence from a hostile statement to a calmer, more constructive one.

In this context, 'backslaps' can be interpreted as a colloquial or informal way of saying something positive, perhaps implying camaraderie or support. However, it might also carry a connotation of insincerity or superficiality, especially when paired with 'beers', which can sometimes be associated with excessive or problematic behavior.\n\nNext, I'll consider why the sentence might be toxic. The combination of 'beers' and 'backslaps' could suggest a dismissive or flippant attitude towards serious issues like suicide, potentially trivializing the topic. The statistic '75% male' might be used to highlight a trend, but without proper context, it could be misleading or insensitive.\n\nTo make the sentence less toxic, the phrase 'it's not all beers and backslaps' will change to 'it's not always beers and backslaps.'

Do not reference external information, prior analysis, or the fact that words were provided.\nSentence: You right, lame. They are burying or hiding him. Lots of places you can hid messed up POs. Possible toxic words: ['lame']", "answer1_body": "I need to determine the toxicity of the sentence by analyzing it for any harmful, offensive, or inappropriate language. The sentence in question is: 'You right, lame. They are burying or hiding him. Lots of places you can hid messed up POs.' The words that struck as toxic are the following: 'lame'.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence to identify any elements that could be considered harmful or offensive. The sentence has a somewhat fragmented structure, which might make it harder to parse, but let's tackle it piece by piece.\n\nThe first part is 'You right, lame.' The word 'right' is an adverb meaning correct or accurate. However, immediately following it is 'lame,' which is an adjective typically used to describe something or someone as uncool or ineffective. The combination 'You right, lame' seems contradictory or at least jarring. It might be intended to convey a sarcastic tone, where 'right' is being used in a backhanded compliment or a critique.\n\nNext, 'They are burying or hiding him.' This part suggests that someone is concealing or covering up information about 'him.' The verb 'burying' or 'hiding' implies secrecy or suppression, which could be interpreted in various contexts, some of which might be negative, such as covering up a scandal or wrongdoing.\n\nThen, 'Lots of places you can hid messed up POs.' Here, 'POs' likely stands for 'posts' or possibly 'problems' or 'points.' The verb 'hid' is a form of 'hide,' which repeats the theme of concealment. 'Messed up' is an idiomatic expression meaning something that is flawed or problematic. So, 'Lots of places you can hid messed up POs' could mean that there are many locations where flawed posts or issues are being concealed.\n\nFocusing on the word 'lame,' it can be offensive if used to mock or belittle someone, especially in contexts where it's used to imply that someone or something is uncool or ineffective. However, its usage here is somewhat ambiguous. It could be part of a sarcastic remark or a genuine observation, depending on the context in which it's used.\n\nConsidering the entire sentence, the presence of 'lame' could be seen as slightly derogatory or dismissive, which might contribute to a toxic tone. However, without additional context, it's hard to definitively categorize the intent behind its use. The sentence also contains phrases like 'burying or hiding,' which could imply deceit or negativity, but they aren't inherently toxic.\n\nFurthermore, the sentence structure is somewhat unclear, which might lead to multiple interpretations. If the sentence is meant to criticize someone for hiding information or being ineffective ('You right, lame'), it could be seen as toxic. On the other hand, if it's a casual remark without malicious intent, it might not be as harmful.\n\nAnother angle to consider is the repetition of the theme of hiding, which could suggest a pattern of behavior that is negative, but not necessarily directly toxic language. The overall sentiment seems critical or disapproving, but whether it's toxic depends on the delivery and the relationship between the speakers.\n\nIn conclusion, while the word 'lame' has the potential to be toxic due to its derogatory connotation, the overall sentence's toxicity is nuanced and context-dependent. Without additional context, it's challenging to definitively label the sentence as toxic, but the use of 'lame' leans it towards a slightly toxic or negative tone.", "answer2_body": "Upon analyzing the sentence, the word 'lame' is present.

The words that struck as toxic are the following: 'cheats', 'throws', 'beggars', 'lock', 'professional'. The word 'cheats' is clearly derogatory, implying deceit or dishonesty. The term 'beggars' has a negative connotation, associating the individuals with begging, which can be seen as derogatory or dismissive. The word 'throws' suggests carelessness or intentional waste, which might imply Wynne is irresponsibly managing her finances. 'Professional' before 'beggars' might be an attempt to emphasize the severity or the organized nature of the begging, adding to the negative perception. The word 'lock up' could be interpreted as a harsh or punitive action, which might be seen as aggressive or authoritarian.\n\nNext, I'll consider the overall tone and implications of the sentence. The sentence seems to be advising a strict action against Wynne, possibly implying that she is making poor financial decisions by giving money to untrustworthy individuals. The use of strong language like 'cheats' and 'beggars' escalates the negativity, making the sentence more confrontational.\n\nTo generate a non-toxic paraphrase, the following changes will need to be made. The word 'throws away' will be replaced with 'spends', which shifts the focus from careless disposal of money to intentional expenditure. The term 'cheats' will remain, but 'professional beggars' will be simplified to 'beggars', which slightly softens the tone. The core instruction to 'lock up' will remain, but the overall language will be less confrontational.\n\nBy replacing 'cheats' with 'cheaters', the focus will shift from the action to the individuals, which might make the language slightly less direct. Additionally, 'throws away' will be replaced with 'spends', which changes the implication from careless disposal to intentional spending. This shift can be seen as less judgmental. The term 'professional beggars' will be simplified to 'beggars', which removes the emphasis on professionalism, potentially reducing the stigma associated with begging.\n\nOverall, the paraphrase will soften the language by replacing more aggressive terms with milder synonyms and slightly altering the phrasing to reduce the confrontational tone without changing the core instruction.", "answer2_body": "Step 1: Examination of Toxic Elements\nThe provided sentence contains several terms that contribute to a negative and accusatory tone.

This term is often used colloquially to refer to someone who is easily deceived or taken advantage of. In this context, it carries a slightly derogatory connotation, implying that the person lacks wisdom or is gullible. The word 'criminal' is straightforward, indicating someone who engages in illegal activities. The words that struck as toxic are the following: 'chump.' The paraphrase will replace 'chump' with 'easily tricked,' which serves the same purpose but frames the characteristic more neutrally. Instead of using a potentially derogatory term, 'easily tricked' will provide a clearer and more objective description of the person's behavior. This change will soften the tone of the original sentence, removing any implicit negativity associated with the term 'chump.' Additionally, the structure of the sentence will remain largely the same, maintaining the relationship between the person and their support for a criminal. The paraphrase will ensure that the meaning is preserved while presenting it in a more neutral and respectful manner. This adjustment will help in avoiding any unintended negative labeling of the individual, focusing instead on their actions in supporting a criminal. Overall, the key modification will be the substitution of 'chump' with 'easily tricked,' which will neutralize the potentially toxic implication of the original term and present the idea more objectively.", "answer2_body": "The provided sentence contains words that convey toxic behavior.

This adjective is often used to insult someone's intelligence or make a derogatory comment. In the context of the sentence, it's labeling something as unintelligent or foolish, which can be considered toxic because it belittles or demeans the subject. Next, the word 'fake' refers to 'fake news', which is a term often associated with misinformation or discredited information sources. While 'fake' itself isn't inherently toxic, in this context, it's part of a phrase that can be derogatory towards news organizations or sources, potentially undermining trust and credibility. The word 'got' seems to be a casual contraction and doesn't carry toxicity on its own, but in combination with 'dumbest', it reinforces the negative sentiment of the sentence. The words that struck as toxic are the following: 'dumbest', 'got', and 'fake'. To make the sentence less toxic, 'dumbest' will be replaced with 'worst'. 'Worst' is a stronger negative descriptor but doesn't carry the connotation of intelligence or foolishness that 'dumbest' does. This shift will remove the personal insult aspect while still maintaining a strong negative opinion about the content. Additionally, the sentence structure will remain largely similar, keeping the focus on the negative evaluation of the source ('fake news'), but by replacing 'dumbest' with 'worst', the toxicity related to personal insult will be mitigated. The overall tone will remain critical but will avoid language that directly attacks intelligence or character. In summary, the key change will be the substitution of 'dumbest' with 'worst', which will reduce the personal derogatory tone, thereby making the sentence less toxic while still expressing a strong negative sentiment.", "answer2_body": "In the provided sentence, terms like 'dumbest' and 'fake' are utilized in a manner that conveys strong negative judgments. The use of 'dumbest' serves to harshly criticize the subject by implying a lack of intelligence, while 'fake news' suggests deceitfulness and undermines the credibility of the information being discussed. The sentence exhibits toxic behavior through the use of derogatory and dismissive language. Words like 'dumbest' and 'fake' intensify negative sentiments, fostering an environment of disdain and mistrust. To generate a non-toxic paraphrase, the words that strike as toxic will be identified and replaced with less harsh alternatives. For example, 'dumbest' will be substituted with 'worst,' which softens the level of criticism without eliminating the negative sentiment entirely.

We are perfectly able to home-grow our own criminals.' The words that struck as toxic are the following: 'American', 'home-grow', 'white'.\n\n1. **'American'**: This is a nationality term and is not inherently toxic. It could be used neutrally or in various contexts without being offensive. In the given sentence, it doesn't seem to carry a toxic connotation.\n\n2. **'home-grow'**: This term is a compound of 'home' and 'grow,' likely meaning to cultivate or produce something domestically. The word itself doesn't have a toxic meaning. It might be used in a metaphorical sense here, possibly implying that the country is responsible for producing its own criminals.\n\n3. **'white'**: This is a racial descriptor. While it's generally acceptable to refer to someone's race in a neutral context, using it without additional context might be seen as potentially insensitive or stereotypical. However, in this sentence, it's used to describe a specific individual, which is a factual statement and not inherently toxic.\n\nNext, I'll analyze the overall tone and context of the sentence. The sentence appears to be a factual statement about a recent event involving a shooter. It doesn't contain any overtly offensive language, slurs, or derogatory terms. The phrase 'home-grow our own criminals' could be interpreted as a commentary on domestic crime rates or the idea that the country is responsible for its own criminal elements, which is a neutral or even critical statement rather than a toxic one.\n\nAdditionally, the sentence starts with 'Um,' which is an interjection often used to seek confirmation or to hesitate, indicating a lack of intent to offend. This further suggests that the sentence is not intended to be toxic.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the sentence does not contain harmful, offensive, or inappropriate language. The use of the words 'American' and 'white' is descriptive and not inherently toxic in this context. The phrase 'home-grow our own criminals' is a neutral statement that doesn't carry a toxic meaning.", "answer2_body": "The provided sentence does not contain inherently harmful, offensive, or inappropriate language.

The words that struck as toxic are the following: 'evil' and 'stupid.' 'Evil' is a strong negative label, and 'stupid' is derogatory. These words can be hurtful or offensive. To make it less toxic, the sentence will need to soften the language by removing such strong labels and using more neutral or constructive terms. For example, it could be rephrased as: 'Only two types of people have ever supported conservatism, those who are evil and those who are unintelligent.' This way, it still conveys the idea without using derogatory language. Alternatively, rephrasing to focus on behavior rather than labeling individuals might help, such as: 'Only two types of people have ever supported conservatism: those who act out of malice and those who lack understanding.' This approach maintains the original meaning without resorting to potentially offensive terms.", "answer2_body": "1. **Examination of the Provided Sentence:**\n\nThe sentence contains certain words and phrases that contribute to a negative and derogatory tone.

This term is often used to express strong disapproval or contempt, which can be perceived as toxic or offensive in certain contexts. It carries a negative connotation, implying that the content is of poor quality or completely without value. Next, I'll consider the phrase 'absolute rubbish.' The addition of 'absolute' intensifies the negativity, making the statement more forceful and potentially more offensive. This combination strongly dismisses whatever is being referred to, which can be harmful in communication as it may belittle or demean the subject. The words that strike as toxic are the following: 'rubbish' and 'absolute.' To make the sentence less toxic, 'rubbish' will be replaced with 'meaningless words.' While 'meaningless' still carries a negative implication, it is less direct and less likely to be perceived as offensive. It conveys a similar sentiment without using language that might provoke strong negative emotions or be taken personally. The change from 'absolute' to omitting it will reduce the intensity of the negativity, making the statement less confrontational. Additionally, 'meaningless' will focus on the lack of sense in the words rather than outright dismissing them as 'rubbish,' which can be seen as more derogatory.

Sudan? and so on UN is much like Trudeau - all talk.'\n\nThe sentence starts with 'UN is useless militarily,' which uses the word 'useless'. This is a strong negative assessment of the United Nations' military capabilities. While 'useless' is a subjective term, it can be perceived as offensive or critical, especially when directed at an international organization.\n\nNext, the sentence asks, 'remember Rwanda? Bosnia/Kosovo - settled by NATO.' This part brings up historical conflicts and mentions NATO, but it doesn't contain any toxic language. It seems to be referencing past interventions.\n\nThen, it continues, 'Saddam Hussein and Taliban - cannot count on UN.' Here, the word 'cannot' is used, which is a statement of inability or distrust. While 'cannot' is not inherently toxic, in this context, it reinforces the negative sentiment towards the UN.\n\nThe sentence proceeds, 'Syria - cannot depend on UN or Obama's \"red line\".' Again, the word 'cannot' is used, emphasizing distrust in both the UN and a specific political figure, Obama. The phrase 'red line' refers to a political statement made by Obama regarding Syria, which might be seen as a critique of his policies.\n\nFollowing that, 'Somalia? Sudan? and so on UN is much like Trudeau - all talk.' Here, the word 'all talk' is used to criticize the UN, comparing it to Trudeau, likely referring to Justin Trudeau, the Canadian Prime Minister. 'All talk' implies that the UN is ineffective without action, which is a negative assessment.\n\nNow, considering the words that struck as toxic:\n- 'Useless' is a strong negative term that can be offensive when used to describe an organization like the UN.\n- 'UN' is being criticized, but it's the organization itself, not a personal attack.\n- 'Cannot' is used to express inability or distrust, which adds to the negative sentiment but isn't inherently toxic.\n\nThe sentence also makes comparisons between the UN and political leaders like Trudeau, suggesting ineffectiveness and lack of action. While these comparisons are critical, they are part of a broader argument rather than containing overtly toxic language.\n\nHowever, the overall tone is critical and dismissive of the UN's military effectiveness and reliability, which could be perceived as toxic by those who support or work with the UN.

This adjective carries a negative connotation, implying a lack of courage or bravery. In the context of the sentence, labeling the trolls as 'cowardly' contributes to a derogatory tone, which can be perceived as toxic because it attacks the character or behavior of the individuals involved without addressing the issue directly.\n\nNext, the word 'trolls' itself can be ambiguous. While 'trolls' can refer to mythical creatures, in modern usage, it often refers to individuals who post inflammatory or off-topic messages online. The term can be derogatory and is sometimes used to insult or demean someone's behavior without addressing the specific actions.\n\nThe word 'no' in the phrase 'no coincidence' serves as a negation, but in the context of toxic language, it might be used to dismiss or downplay certain behaviors or feelings, which can be dismissive or unsupportive.\n\nTo make the sentence less toxic, the adjective 'cowardly' will be removed from 'cowardly trolls'. By doing so, it will eliminate the negative characterization of the individuals, thereby reducing the toxic nature of the statement. The removal of 'cowardly' will shift the focus from the personal attributes of the trolls to their behavior or pattern of appearing on weekends, making the statement less emotionally charged and more neutral.\n\nAdditionally, the original sentence uses the word 'no' to negate coincidence, which could imply skepticism or dismissal. In the revised sentence, this negation will remain, but without the intensifying adjective, the overall tone will become less confrontational.\n\nIn summary, the key change will be the removal of the adjective 'cowardly', which is a primary source of toxicity in the original sentence.

'coacg' seems like a misspelling or slang, possibly intended to be 'coach', which doesn't inherently carry toxicity. 'nvr' is an abbreviation for 'never', which is not toxic.
